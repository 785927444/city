I have identified the root cause of the persistent layout gap.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The gap is caused by the CSS class `flex-sc` used on the content container. In your project's utility classes, `flex-sc` likely stands for "Flex Start Center" (`justify-content: flex-start; align-items: center;`). Because the container is set to fill the remaining height (`flex: 1`), this vertical centering (`align-items: center`) forces the "Policy List" and "Hot Knowledge" sections to float in the middle of the available space, creating a large gap below the Banner.

**Definitive Fix Plan:**
1.  **Remove `flex-sc`**: I will remove this class from the content wrapper `div`.
2.  **Enforce Top Alignment**: I will apply an inline style `display: flex; align-items: flex-start;` to explicitly force the content to align to the top, immediately below the Banner.
3.  **Verify Structure**: I will ensure the parent container uses `flex-direction: column` and the content container fills the remaining space properly without centering.

This will strictly align the content to the top, eliminating the gap completely.
