I will modify `src/views/async/knowledge/index.vue` to adjust the layout of the Policy Regulations page as requested:

1. **Adjust Layout Proportions**:

   * Target the main container for the Policy page (Line 51).

   * Set the "Center" column (Banner + List) and "Right" column (Hot Knowledge) to use Flexbox ratios derived from the user's provided dimensions (1299 vs 421).

   * **Center Column**: Change from `flex: 1` to `flex: 1299` (approx 75.5%).

   * **Right Column**: Change from fixed `width: 280px` to `flex: 421` (approx 24.5%).

2. **Fix Spacing**:

   * Remove the margin-right (`mr15`) from the Center column.

   * Add `gap: 16px` (approx 1% of width, reasonable gap) to the parent Flex container to ensure a clean separation between the two columns.

3. **Correct Banner Height**:

   * Update the inline styles of the Policy Banner to consistently use `280px` (matching the CSS class and user request), replacing the conflicting `180px` values in the inline styles.

4. **Verification**:

   * These changes will strictly align the layout proportions and fix the banner height issue.
