Based on your feedback and the images, I will make the following specific adjustments:

**1. Hide Search Bar in "Policy Regulations" Page:**
   - **Condition:** The search bar container `<div class="bg-white rad8 p15 mb15">` is currently displayed for all pages.
   - **Action:** I will add a `v-if` condition to this container to hide it specifically when `state.activeColumnCode === 'policy'`.

**2. Increase Banner Height:**
   - **Condition:** The current banner height is likely too small (around 180px based on previous CSS).
   - **Action:** I will increase the height of the `.policy-banner` class to a larger value (e.g., **280px** or **320px**) to match the visual proportion in your target design (图2).

**3. Layout Refinement:**
   - Ensure the "Policy Regulations" title within the banner is centered and prominent.
   - Verify that the layout remains consistent with the previous structural fix (Left: Banner+List, Right: Hot Knowledge).

I will proceed with these changes immediately.
