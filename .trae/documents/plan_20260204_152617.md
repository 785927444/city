The error `Failed to connect to github.com port 443: Timed out` indicates a temporary network connection issue with GitHub, which is common.

**Plan:**
1.  **Retry Push:** I will immediately execute the `git push` command again. Network issues are often transient, and a second attempt may succeed.

If this retry also fails, it confirms a persistent network block or instability on the machine's connection to GitHub, which might require you to check your local VPN or proxy settings manually. But for now, I will perform the requested retry.
