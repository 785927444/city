I will modify `src/views/async/knowledge/index.vue` to increase the height and spacing of the "Hot Knowledge" list items as requested.

1.  **Increase Vertical Spacing**:
    *   Change the bottom margin of each list item from `mb30` to **`mb50`**.
    *   Increase the gap between the title and description from `mb8` to **`mb15`**.

2.  **Increase Line Height**:
    *   Increase the line-height of the title and description to **`1.8`** (from 1.5/1.6) to make the text block taller and more readable, matching the "higher" visual request.

3.  **Refine Font Size (Optional but recommended for "higher" feel)**:
    *   Slightly increase the description font from `f12` to `f13` to better fill the space if needed, but primarily focus on the spacing/height attributes.

This will significantly increase the vertical footprint of each "Hot Knowledge" item, matching the provided reference image.
