I will perform the Git operations to push the changes to the remote repository.

**Steps:**
1.  **Check Status:** Run `git status` to see the modified files.
2.  **Add Changes:** Run `git add .` to stage all changes (including the layout fixes, banner height adjustments, and logic improvements).
3.  **Commit:** Run `git commit -m "refactor(knowledge): fix layout gaps, banner height, and sidebar structure"` to commit the changes with a descriptive message.
4.  **Push:** Run `git push` to upload the changes to the remote repository.

I will execute these commands sequentially in the terminal.
