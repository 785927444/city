This behavior—rendering correctly at first and then "snapping" to a smaller size—strongly suggests a **Flexbox layout conflict** where the parent container is constraining the height *after* the initial render.

**Root Cause Diagnosis:**
The Banner is inside a container (`Left Column`) that has `flex: 1` and `flex-direction: column`.
If the *Article List* below the Banner also has `flex: 1` (to fill remaining space) and `overflow-hidden`, and the *parent container* of both has a fixed or constrained height (e.g., `hh100` - height 100%), the Flexbox algorithm might be aggressively shrinking the Banner to make room for the List if the List content is "demanding" more space or if the calculation prioritizes the `flex: 1` child. Even with `flex-shrink: 0`, if the parent is over-constrained, layout shifts can happen.

**Definitive Fix Strategy:**
1.  **Enforce Minimum Height:** Instead of just `height`, I will use `min-height: 280px` and `max-height: 280px`. This tells the browser "under no circumstances should this be smaller than 280px".
2.  **Explicit Flex Basis:** I will set the flex property on the Banner wrapper to `flex: 0 0 280px`.
    *   `0`: Do not grow.
    *   `0`: **Do not shrink** (this is the key).
    *   `280px`: The base size is 280px.
3.  **Check Parent Overflow:** I will ensure the parent container allows scrolling or proper spacing so it doesn't crush the Banner.

By changing the flex definition to explicitly forbid shrinking (`flex-shrink: 0` is sometimes overridden if not combined with a basis) and enforcing `min-height`, we will lock the size in place permanently.
