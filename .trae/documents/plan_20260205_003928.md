I will modify `src/views/async/implementation/basicProjectOverview/index.vue` to align the file upload sections with the user's new requirements (table-based layout instead of cards).

1. **Update State**:

   * Add a `fileList` array to `state.draft` for Step 1 (Project File Upload).

   * Add a `step2FileList` array to `state.draft.step2` for Step 2 (Implementation Plan File Upload).

   * Populate these lists with mock data matching the screenshots (e.g., "Update Potential.pdf", "Function Format.pdf").

2. **Refactor Step 1 File Upload UI**:

   * Replace the existing "Update Potential" / "Function Format" card layout with an `el-table`.

   * Columns: Serial Number, File Type, Upload Time, Uploaded File (Link), Upload Status (Green/Red text), Operation (Delete/View).

   * Add an "Add+" button row at the bottom of the table.

3. **Refactor Step 2 File Upload UI**:

   * Replace the existing card layout inside the `el-tabs` with an `el-table`.

   * Columns: Same as Step 1.

   * Add an "Add+" button row.

   * Ensure the Tabs (Plan Text, Important Charts, Supporting Materials) remain above the table.

4. **Styling**:

   * Match the table header background (`bgi16` or light gray).

   * Style the "Add+" button to look like the design (blue text, centered).

   * Style the status text (Success=Green, Failure=Red).

5. **Verification**:

   * Check that both Step 1 and Step 2 file upload sections now use the table layout shown in the new screenshots.
