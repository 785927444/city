I will modify `src/views/async/implementation/basicProjectOverview/index.vue` to replicate the table-based file upload layout for the "Important Charts" and "Supporting Materials" tabs, matching the "Plan Text" tab.

1. **Update State**:

   * Add `chartsList` and `materialsList` to `state.draft.step2` with empty arrays (or mock data if appropriate, but empty fits "暂无数据" better initially) to support the new tables.

2. **Refactor "Important Charts" (charts) Tab**:

   * Replace the `<div class="p15 tc c9">暂无数据</div>` placeholder with the same `el-table` structure used in "Plan Text".

   * Bind it to `state.draft.step2.chartsList`.

   * Include the "Add+" button row.

3. **Refactor "Supporting Materials" (materials) Tab**:

   * Replace the placeholder with the `el-table` structure.

   * Bind it to `state.draft.step2.materialsList`.

   * Include the "Add+" button row.

4. **Verification**:

   * Ensure all three tabs (Plan Text, Important Charts, Supporting Materials) now share the exact same visual layout (Table + Add Button).
