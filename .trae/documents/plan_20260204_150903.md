Based on your feedback that the Banner is still short, the issue is likely due to the `scoped` style attribute in Vue. When styles are scoped, Vue appends a unique attribute (like `data-v-xxxx`) to elements, but sometimes dynamically added classes or structure changes don't pick up these styles correctly if the selector specificity isn't high enough or if there's a conflict.

Alternatively, the use of utility classes like `flex-col-cc` or `overflow-hidden` might be imposing their own height or flex constraints that override the `height: 280px` setting.

**Investigation & Fix Plan:**

1.  **Force Height with `!important`:** I will add `!important` to the height property in the CSS class `.policy-banner` to override any other conflicting styles.
    *   Change: `height: 280px !important;`
2.  **Inline Style Backup:** To be absolutely certain, I will also add `style="height: 280px"` directly to the HTML element. This has the highest specificity and guarantees the height is applied.
3.  **Check for Flex Conflicts:** I will inspect the `flex-col-cc` class usage. If it includes `flex: 1` or similar, it might be shrinking the element. I will ensure `flex-shrink: 0` is present (which I see I added previously, but I will double-check its effectiveness).

By applying the height directly inline, we bypass any CSS specificity or scoping issues that are "blocking" the height change.
