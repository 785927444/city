# Git Pull & Merge Plan

## 1. Save Local Changes
Commit all current modifications to the local `main` branch to ensure work is saved before pulling.
- Files to commit:
    - `vue/src/views/async/knowledge/index.vue` (Knowledge Base layout fixes)
    - `vue/src/views/async/implementation/basicProjectOverview/index.vue` (Implementation Plan form & file upload)
    - `init_t_file_data.sql` (New mock data script)
    - Other modified files (`README.md`, backend files, etc.)

## 2. Pull Remote Changes
Execute `git pull origin main` to fetch and merge updates from the colleague.

## 3. Conflict Resolution Strategy
If conflicts occur during the merge, I will apply the following rules based on your instructions:

### A. Knowledge Base Module (`src/views/async/knowledge/*`)
- **Strategy**: **Keep Local ("Ours")**.
- **Reason**: You specified "Knowledge Base module parts are based on mine".

### B. Implementation/Scheduling Modules
- **Strategy**: **Accept Remote ("Theirs")** generally, **EXCEPT** for the specific file we just worked on (`basicProjectOverview/index.vue`).
- **Nuance**:
    - For `src/views/async/implementation/basicProjectOverview/index.vue`: I will attempt to **Merge** changes. If strict conflict arises, I will prioritize **preserving the File Upload/Form features** we just built, while trying to incorporate colleague's changes if they don't overlap. (If I strictly took "theirs" here, we would lose the entire form we just built).
    - For **all other files** in `implementation`, `planView`, `schedule`, etc.: I will accept **Remote ("Theirs")**.

## 4. Final Verification
- Verify that the "Policy Regulations" (Knowledge Base) page still looks correct (Your layout).
- Verify that the "New Project -> Implementation Plan" form still has the Table-based file upload (Your new feature).
