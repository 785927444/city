Based on your feedback and the provided image, I have re-analyzed the layout structure.

**Corrected Layout Structure Analysis:**
The previous implementation had the "Hot Knowledge" section nested *inside* the main content container, sharing space with the Banner. This was incorrect.

According to your new diagram/description:
1.  **Main Container (Flex Row):** The entire "Policy Regulations" area should be a horizontal flex container.
2.  **Left Column (Flex Column):**
    *   **Banner:** Sits at the top of the Left Column.
    *   **Policy List:** Sits below the Banner in the Left Column.
3.  **Right Column (Hot Knowledge):**
    *   This is a completely separate vertical column that sits to the *right* of the entire Left Column (Banner + List).
    *   It should be independent and extend the full height, not be pushed down by the Banner.

**Implementation Plan:**
1.  **Restructure HTML:** I will rewrite the template structure for the "policy" section.
    *   Create a top-level Flex Row container.
    *   **Left Child (Flex: 1):** Contains the Banner (top) and the Article List (bottom).
    *   **Right Child (Width: 260px):** Contains the "Hot Knowledge" section.
2.  **Adjust Styles:**
    *   Ensure the Left Column takes up the remaining width.
    *   Ensure the Right Column has a fixed width and proper margin/spacing from the left column.
    *   Remove the previous nested structure that caused the misalignment.

This structure guarantees that the "Hot Knowledge" sidebar is independent of the Banner's height and aligns correctly with the top of the page, matching your design intent.
