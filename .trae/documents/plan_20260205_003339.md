I will implement the complex "Implementation Plan" (Step 2) form in the "New Project" dialog within `src/views/async/implementation/basicProjectOverview/index.vue`.

1. **Update State Management**:

   * Extend `state.draft` or add `state.step2` to include fields for Project Information (Plan Name, Compilation Unit, Approval Time, Summary, Conditions).

   * Add state for "Project Tasks" (Tabs, Task Lists for "Key Implementation" and "Rectification", Dynamic Year Columns).

   * Add state for "Time Sequence Management" (List of phases).

   * Add state for "File Uploads" (Tabs for Text/Charts/Materials, and nested file slots).

2. **Implement Step 2 UI**:

   * Replace the placeholder `<div>实施方案</div>` with a full layout.

   * **Project Information Section**: Add Form inputs.

   * **Project Tasks Section**: Add `el-tabs` and `el-table`. Implement the "Add Year" button logic (visually) and the table structure with dynamic goal columns.

   * **Time Sequence Section**: Add `el-table` for managing time-phased tasks.

   * **File Upload Section**: Add `el-tabs` and file upload cards using the existing `UploadText` component pattern (similar to Step 1).

3. **Refine Styles**:

   * Match the spacing, font sizes, and layout structure (e.g., Grid/Flex) to the provided screenshots.

4. **Verification**:

   * Ensure the dialog content matches the visual design in Figure 2 and Figure 3 when proceeding to Step 2.
