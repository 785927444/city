I have analyzed the codebase and identified the necessary changes to address all your requests. Here is the detailed implementation plan:

### 1. Text Modification

* **Target File:** `vue/src/views/async/knowledge/UserArticles.vue`

* **Action:** Change the button text "新增内容" (New Content) to "发布内容" (Publish Content).

### 2. New Project Page Improvements

* **Target File:** `vue/src/views/async/implementation/basicProjectOverview/index.vue`

* **Button Overlap:**

  * Adjust the layout of "Map Drawing" (地块绘制) and "Click Upload" buttons to prevent overlap.

  * Move the "Map Drawing" button above the map display area as requested.

* **Map Placeholder:**

  * Add a placeholder map image to the large drawing box area for demonstration purposes.

* **Form Styling:**

  * Replace all `el-radio-button` components with `el-radio` to achieve the requested "dot selection" style for "Yes/No" options.

* **Demo Data:**

  * Inject mock data into `projectCategoryLevel1Options` and `projectCategoryLevel2Options` so the "Project Category" dropdown shows data for demonstration.

### 3. "Policies and Regulations" Page Redesign

* **Target File:** `vue/src/views/async/knowledge/column.vue`

* **Action:** Implement a specific layout when the category is "Policies and Regulations" (`policy`).

  * **Banner:** Add a blue gradient banner with the title "政策法规" at the top.

  * **Layout:** Create a two-column layout (Left: Article List, Right: Hot Knowledge).

  * **Article List:** Style list items to show Date (e.g., 01.08), Title, and Publish Unit/Number as per your description.

  * **Hot Knowledge:** Add a right sidebar section displaying "Hot Knowledge" with related titles.

### 4. "Excellent Cases" & "Expert Think Tank" Grid View

* **Target File:** `vue/src/views/async/knowledge/column.vue`

* **Action:** Implement a Grid Card view when the category is "优秀案例" (`case`) or "专家智库" (`expert`).

  * **Grid Layout:** Replace the current table view with a responsive grid layout.

  * **Card Design:** Create cards featuring a standard aspect ratio (16:9) cover image, title, and basic info.

  * **Cover Image:** Ensure the cards use the cover image field (or a placeholder if missing) with consistent sizing.

凡是落实到项目里开发的 开发到页面当中 会被 用户看得见的地方  都必须是使用中文，例如“发布”这种 在页面中的任何文字\
I will proceed with these changes in the order listed above.
