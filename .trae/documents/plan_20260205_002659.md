I will modify `src/views/async/knowledge/index.vue` to address the user's specific feedback regarding the Right Column styling and the Banner height.

1.  **Reduce Banner Height**:
    *   Change the inline styles for the `.policy-banner` from `280px` to **`140px`** (reducing it by half as requested).

2.  **Update "Hot Knowledge" (Right Column) Styling**:
    *   **Header**: Remove the `bl-primary` (blue left border) and `pl10` (padding) from the "热门知识" title to match the plain text style in the provided image.
    *   **List Spacing**: Increase the bottom margin of list items from `mb20` to `mb30` to match the wider spacing in the design.

3.  **Refine Date Format (Left Column)**:
    *   Update the year display in the Policy List to include hyphens (e.g., `- 2023 -`) to match the `- 2020 -` style shown in the design image.
    *   Change the date color from `c-primary` (blue) to standard text color (black/dark grey) if the image suggests it, but I will stick to the structure first. *Correction*: The user didn't explicitly complain about the date color, but I will update the *format* (hyphens) as it's a clear visual difference.

This plan directly addresses the "too high" banner and the "format" of the right-side list.
